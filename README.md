# 🌧️ RainRush - Risk of Rain 2 Performance Tracker

RainRush is a full-stack performance tracking tool built for **Risk of Rain 2**. It integrates directly with the game via a custom mod and provides a desktop application interface to track, log, and review runs.

This project is currently in **paused development**, but the foundation is complete and functional.

## 🧠 Why This Exists

RainRush was created out of frustration with the lack of persistent, personalized performance tracking in Risk of Rain 2. The goal was to build something that would:
- Capture and analyze real gameplay
- Help players reflect on performance
- Serve as a base for future stat tracking or gameplay insights

---

## 💤 Current Status
📌 RainRush is currently in private development.
The core system is functional and complete, including:

Tauri desktop application

Express API backend

MySQL database integration

In-game mod for data injection

The app runs end-to-end locally and has been tested with live Risk of Rain 2 gameplay.

## 🎯 Future Plan:
The goal is to eventually host the platform publicly, allowing users to:

Create accounts

Download the desktop app

Sync their gameplay sessions

Track long-term performance data across runs

However, this will require additional development and testing to ensure stability and security.

---


The project is currently paused for personal energy recovery, but it remains fully functional and may be launched when ready.
